        "## **Current strategy:**\n",
        "1. **Implement an LLM-based extractor** - I chose an LLM-based extractor rather than NER because I am more familiar with this technique, so would be faster to implement in the 2 hour limit, and there could be some complexities around natural language in clinical notes that the NER might find difficult to handle (e.g. inference of complications).\n",
        "2. **Entities to extract** - I decided to focus on extracting complications related to T2D, since this seems like an important outcome measure for patients with T2D that wasn't always explicitly mentioned in all notes (which also reinforced my decision to go with an LLM approach rather than NER). However, because I chose the LLM approach, I found that the model accuracy declined the more entities I chose to put into the JSON output.\n",
        "Therefore, it was an explicit tradeoff that I made to get higher accuracy on the more important outcome measure (complications) at the expense of extracting more entities (e.g. lifestyle factors, plans).\n",
        "3. **Validation** - I use json-repair to fix any invalid JSON that the LLM produces. If the JSON is so borked that the json-repair library can't fix it, I ask the LLM to re-analyze the note (with a higher temperature). We'll repeat this 3 times, and if all attempts fail, we'll output an error JSON.\n",
        "4. **Evaluation** - I mostly tried using model grading for evaluation. However, this approach doesn't seem to work very well with the current grading prompt. My prompt was not specific enough for the grader to identify\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Future strategy / improvements:**\n",
        "1. **Overall approach** - A heirarchical/multi-layered NER & LLM combination approach might be less error prone and more structured than either alone. For example, if we could extract the relevant entities using NER, then we could use an LLM to standardize the entities according to a certain coding strategy, yielding more structured outputs. Then another LLM layer could synthesize the structured NER outputs, extrapolating complications based on the pre-structured entities.\n",
        "2. **Entities to extract** - One of the largest issues I faced was related to variable term formats (e.g. \"PRN\" vs \"as needed\", or A1c vs HbA1C, or symptoms described in different ways). One idea is to add a term normalization step (such that all terms are in LOINC or SNOMED codes, or in FHIR format) as part of either a follow-on step or a precursor step (ie. entity linking). This could be done using a RAG method that searches through FHIR/LOINC/SNOMED documentation and identifies the proper mapping for each entity.\n",
        "3. **Validation** - I didn't evaluate how well repair_json worked, so I'm not positive it's the best option. Given more time I would've tried OpenAI's function calling or \"JSON mode\".\n",
        "4. **Evaluation** - I mostly tried using model grading for evaluation. However, this approach doesn't seem to work very well with the current grading prompt (just via manual inspection). A way to get more accurate grades is to use a larger model to do the grading, or to hand curate ground truth labels for the test data and have a model compare the output vs the ground truth (I didn't want to do this out of time management). It also would've helped if I had been able to map key entities to the appropriate terminology. Otherwise it's difficult for the grader to know what is the right terminology.\n"

Other comorbidity includes hypertension, managed with Lisinopril 20 mg daily. Nurse Linda noted that he had tested negative for COVID-19 last month.\\n\\nNext step: schedule a fasting glucose test in two weeks to reassess.

He also mentions he\\u2019s been skipping breakfast, which might contribute to blood sugar swings.\\n\\nAssessment & Plan: Evaluate orthostatic hypotension.
